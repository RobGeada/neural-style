# neural-style

## About
This is a modified version of Anish Athalye's implementation of [neural-style](https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style). Specifically, I have changed the `stylize.py` script to allow for the saving and loading of trained models. The full details of these changes are outlined [here](https://github.com/RobGeada/neural-style/commit/e1cacb552c44203f866c93a7d5a894353877fb07#diff-efc232162beac9514aca8b8991751a4a).
